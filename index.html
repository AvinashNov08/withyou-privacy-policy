      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="muted">Last Updated: 2026-01-27</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        With You ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting
        your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share
        information when you use our location tracking application.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Phone Number (provided by you): You enter your phone number manually to identify your
          account and enable location sharing. We do not read your phone number from your device or
          SIM, we do not request phone-state or phone-number permissions, and we do not use OTP/SMS
          verification.
        </li>
        <li>
          Contacts (Optional): If you choose the "Pick from Contacts" option while adding a user, we
          request Contacts permission to let you select a phone number from your phonebook. We do not
          upload or store your entire contacts list. Only the phone number you select is used to send
          a tracking request.
        </li>
        <li>
          Location Data (Foreground/Background): We collect your device's location data (latitude,
          longitude, timestamp, and accuracy) while location sharing is enabled. Foreground updates use
          a foreground service with a persistent notification, and background updates allow periodic sync
          (about every 1 hour) when the app is not in use. When a trusted contact requests a refresh, the
          app may send a one-time location update if sharing is enabled. Location data is also cached
          locally on your device for offline access and faster performance. Offline map history is stored
          locally for up to 30 days and is not uploaded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Device Information: We may collect device information such as device model, operating system
          version, and unique device identifiers to ensure compatibility and improve our services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Usage Data: We may collect information about how you use the app, including which features you
          use and how often you use them, to improve our services.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cached Data: To improve performance and enable offline functionality, we store a local copy of
          your location data, relationships, and user information on your device using Room Database. We
          also store offline map history for up to 30 days on your device only. This cached data is
          automatically synchronized with our servers (except the offline map history) and can be cleared
          at any time through the app settings.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide location tracking services</li>
        <li>Enable location sharing with your approved contacts</li>
        <li>Send push notifications about tracking requests</li>
        <li>Improve and maintain our services</li>
        <li>Ensure the security and safety of our users</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Your data is stored securely using multiple layers of protection:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cloud Storage: Your data is stored in Firebase, a cloud service provided by Google, with encryption
          in transit using HTTPS/TLS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Local Storage: To improve performance and enable offline access, we use Room Database to cache your
          data locally on your device. This local cache is only accessible by the app. You can clear this
          cache at any time by logging out or through app settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Security Measures: We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures, including encrypted
          connections (HTTPS/TLS), to protect your personal information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Minimization: We only collect and store essential data (phone number, location coordinates,
          timestamp, accuracy) to minimize privacy risks.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
        strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute
        security.
      </p>

      <h2>Location Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        Location data is only shared with users who have been explicitly added and approved by you through
        tracking requests. You have full control over who can track your location. You can revoke access at
        any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Permissions: Location sharing uses precise/approximate location permissions, and background location
        is used for updates when the app is not in use. Contacts permission is optional and only used for the
        contact picker. We do not request phone-state or phone-number permissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Location Update Frequency: To optimize battery life and data usage, your location is updated to our
        servers approximately every 1 hour. When someone requests a refresh from the map screen, the app uses
        a short real-time window (about 10 seconds) to try to capture a fresh location without changing the
        hourly schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cached Data: Location data is cached locally on your device for faster access and offline functionality.
        Offline map history is stored locally for up to 30 days. Local cache is automatically synchronized with
        our servers (except offline map history) and is cleared when you log out.
      </p>

      <h2>Your Rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Access your personal information stored in our system</li>
        <li>Delete your account and data (both cloud and local cache)</li>
        <li>Clear local cached data through app settings or logout</li>
        <li>Revoke location sharing permissions at any time</li>
        <li>Request information about how your data is used</li>
        <li>Control location update frequency (background updates occur hourly)</li>
        <li>Request a copy of your data in a portable format</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Caching and Optimization</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Local Cache: Your location data, relationships, and user information are cached locally on your device
          using Room Database. Offline map history is stored locally for up to 30 days and is not uploaded.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cache Purpose: This cache enables faster app performance, reduces network usage by 85-90%, and allows the
          app to work offline.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cache Duration: Cached location data is considered fresh for 5 minutes, and relationship data for 10 minutes.
          After this time, data is refreshed from our servers when you use the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cache Control: You can clear the local cache at any time by logging out of the app. The cache is also automatically
          cleared when you delete your account.
        </li>
        <li>
          Data Sync: The local cache is automatically synchronized with our servers to ensure data consistency.
        </li>
      </ul>
